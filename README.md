    # 🚗 Fuel Consumption vs Emissions Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between **fuel consumption** and **CO₂ emissions** using **linear regression**. The goal is to predict vehicle emissions based on fuel consumption and engine characteristics.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **File:** `fuelconsumption.csv`
- **Columns:**
  - `MODEL` – Vehicle model  
  - `MAKE` – Manufacturer  
  - `FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB` – Combined fuel consumption (L/100km)  
  - `CO2EMISSIONS` – CO₂ emissions (g/km)  
  - `CYLINDERS` – Number of cylinders  
  - `ENGINE_SIZE` – Engine displacement (L)  
- **Size:** Hundreds of vehicle records

## 📊 Key Analyses
✔ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, duplicates  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Distribution of fuel consumption & emissions  
✔ **Linear Regression Model** – Predicting emissions based on fuel consumption  
✔ **Model Evaluation** – Assessing regression performance using RMSE & R²  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning (Linear Regression)
